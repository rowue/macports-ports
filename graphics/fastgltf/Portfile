    A modern C++17 glTF 2.0 library focused on speed, correctness, and \
    usability

long_description    \
    ${name} is a speed and usability focused glTF 2.0 library written in \
    modern C++17 with minimal dependencies. It uses SIMD in various areas to \
    decrease the time the application spends parsing and loading glTF data. \
    By taking advantage of modern C++17 \(and optionally C++20\) it also \
    provides easy and safe access to the properties and data. The library \
    supports the entirety of glTF 2.0 specification, including many \
    extensions. By default, ${name} will only do the absolute minimum to work \
    with a glTF model. However, it brings many additional features to ease \
    working with the data, including accessor tools, the ability to directly \
    write to mapped GPU buffers, and decomposing transform matrices.
