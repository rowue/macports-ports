description             World's fastest and most advanced password recovery utility.

long_description        hashcat is the world's fastest and most advanced \
                        password recovery utility, supporting five unique modes \
                        of attack for over 200 highly-optimized hashing algorithms. \
                        hashcat currently supports CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware \
                        accelerators on Linux, Windows, and macOS, and has \
                        facilities to help enable distributed password cracking
