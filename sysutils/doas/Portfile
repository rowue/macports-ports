description         a utility that lets a user run a command as another user

long_description    ${name} allows a user to run a command as though they \
                    were another user. Typically doas is used to allow \
                    non-privileged users to run commands as though they were \
                    the root user. ${name} offers two benefits over sudo: its \
                    configuration file has a simple syntax and it is smaller, \
                    requiring less effort to audit the code. This makes it \
                    harder for both admins and coders to make mistakes that \
                    potentially open security holes in the system.
